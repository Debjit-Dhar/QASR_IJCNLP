# Implementation Summary: Google Speech Commands Dataset with Three Model Saving Strategies

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of both normal Whisper and quantum Whisper models on the Google Speech Commands Dataset with three different model saving strategies based on different metrics.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dataset Integration

**Previous**: Used LibriSpeech dataset via Hugging Face datasets library
**Current**: Uses Google Speech Commands Dataset via torchaudio

```python
# Old approach (LibriSpeech)
dataset = load_dataset("librispeech_asr", "clean")

# New approach (Google Speech Commands)
train_dataset = torchaudio.datasets.SPEECHCOMMANDS(
    root="./data", 
    url="speech_commands_v0.02",
    subset="training",
    download=True
)
```

### 2. Three Model Saving Strategies

Both training scripts now save three different models based on different validation metrics:

#### Normal Whisper Models:
- `best_whisper_val_acc.pth` - Best validation accuracy
- `best_whisper_val_loss.pth` - Best validation loss  
- `best_whisper_val_wer.pth` - Best validation WER

#### Quantum Whisper Models:
- `best_quantum_whisper_val_acc.pth` - Best validation accuracy
- `best_quantum_whisper_val_loss.pth` - Best validation loss
- `best_quantum_whisper_val_wer.pth` - Best validation WER

### 3. Model Evaluation

All three saved models are evaluated on the test set to compare their performance:

```python
def evaluate_all_models(model_class, test_loader, device='cpu'):
    """Evaluate all three saved models on test set"""
    results = {}
    
    # Load and evaluate best validation accuracy model
    # Load and evaluate best validation loss model  
    # Load and evaluate best validation WER model
    
    return results
```

## Implementation Details

### Dataset Structure

The Google Speech Commands Dataset provides:
- **Training set**: ~84,843 samples
- **Validation set**: ~9,981 samples  
- **Test set**: ~11,005 samples
- **Classes**: 35 different speech commands (e.g., "up", "down", "left", "right", "yes", "no", etc.)

### Audio Processing

1. **Audio Loading**: Uses torchaudio's SPEECHCOMMANDS dataset
2. **Preprocessing**: Converts to mel spectrograms using Whisper's preprocessing
3. **Label Conversion**: Maps string labels to integer indices for classification

### Model Architecture

#### Normal Whisper:
- Uses official Whisper Tiny architecture
- Trains from scratch on Google Speech Commands
- Classification head on top of Whisper encoder

#### Quantum Whisper:
- Replaces classical Conv1d layers with quantum equivalents
- Uses PennyLane for quantum circuit implementation
- Freezes non-quantum layers during training

### Training Process

1. **Data Loading**: Loads train/val/test splits from Google Speech Commands
2. **Model Initialization**: Creates Whisper model with appropriate number of classes
3. **Training Loop**: 
   - Tracks three metrics: validation accuracy, validation loss, validation WER
   - Saves best model for each metric
   - Uses cosine annealing learning rate scheduler
4. **Evaluation**: Tests all three saved models on test set

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Experiments

1. **Evaluate Pretrained Whisper**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_pretrained_whisper.py
   ```

2. **Train Whisper from Scratch**:
   ```bash
   python train_whisper_from_scratch.py
   ```

3. **Train Quantum Whisper**:
   ```bash
   python train_quantum_whisper.py
   ```

### Expected Outputs

Each training script will generate:

#### Model Files:
- `best_*_val_acc.pth` - Best validation accuracy model
- `best_*_val_loss.pth` - Best validation loss model
- `best_*_val_wer.pth` - Best validation WER model
- `*_final.pth` - Final model after training

#### Results Files:
- `*_training_history.json` - Training metrics and results
- `*_training_results.png` - Training plots
- `*_evaluation_results.png` - Evaluation plots

#### Test Results:
Each script will output test performance for all three saved models:
```
Best Val Acc Model - Test WER: 0.1234, Test Acc: 85.67%
Best Val Loss Model - Test WER: 0.1345, Test Acc: 84.32%
Best Val WER Model - Test WER: 0.1123, Test Acc: 86.45%
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Dataset Integration
- Uses Google Speech Commands Dataset (not LibriSpeech)
- Proper train/validation/test splits
- Handles 35 different speech command classes

### ✅ Three Model Saving Strategies
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: Saves model with highest validation accuracy
- **Best Validation Loss**: Saves model with lowest validation loss
- **Best Validation WER**: Saves model with lowest validation WER

### ✅ Comprehensive Evaluation
- Tests all three saved models on test set
- Compares performance across different metrics
- Provides detailed class-wise accuracy analysis

### ✅ Both Normal and Quantum Implementations
- Normal Whisper: Classical implementation
- Quantum Whisper: Quantum-enhanced with frozen pretrained layers
- Both use same dataset and evaluation methodology

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_google_speech_commands.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test dataset loading
- ✅ Verify model saving strategies
- ✅ Validate all scripts work correctly
- ✅ Confirm both normal and quantum implementations function

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully:
1. **Uses Google Speech Commands Dataset** instead of LibriSpeech
2. **Saves three different models** based on different validation metrics
3. **Evaluates all models** on the test set for comprehensive comparison
4. **Works for both normal and quantum Whisper** implementations
5. **Provides detailed analysis** and visualization of results

The system is now ready for full experimentation and comparison between normal and quantum Whisper models on the Google Speech Commands Dataset.
